# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** created by John Gruber in 2004. It was designed with one core philosophy in mind: _a document should be readable as plain text, even before it's rendered._

Today, Markdown is used **everywhere** — from GitHub READMEs and blog posts to documentation, note-taking apps, and even chat platforms.

## Why use Markdown?

**It's simple.** You don't need a rich text editor. All you need is a plain `.md` file and any text editor. The syntax is **_intuitive by design_** — wrapping a word in asterisks makes it bold, and that makes sense even without rendering.

**It's portable.** A Markdown file is just text. No proprietary formats, no corruption, no version incompatibility.

**It's widely supported.** Platforms that render Markdown include GitHub, GitLab, Reddit, Discord, Notion, Obsidian, and most static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo.

## Core Syntax

| Style         | Syntax              | Output            |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Bold          | `**text**`          | **text**          |
| Italic        | `*text*`            | _text_            |
| Bold + Italic | `***text***`        | **_text_**        |
| Strikethrough | `~~text~~`          | ~~text~~          |
| Highlight     | `<mark>text</mark>` | <mark>text</mark> |
| Superscript   | `<sup>text</sup>`   | E=mc<sup>2</sup>  |
| Subscript     | `<sub>text</sub>`   | H<sub>2</sub>O    |

Headings are prefixed with `#` symbols — one `#` for H1, two for H2, and so on.

Links follow the pattern `[text](url)`, and images/videos are nearly identical: `![alt text](image.png)`.

## Code in Markdown

One of Markdown's most powerful features for developers is its code formatting. For inline references, use single backticks: `const x = 42`

For multi-line blocks, use triple backticks with an optional language identifier:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World")); // Hello, World!
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

print(fibonacci(10))  # 55
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are great for callouts, citations, or pull quotes:

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and is
> commonly used for referenced material or important callouts.

You can even cite attribution:

> "The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible."
> <cite>John Gruber[^1]</cite>

## Lists

Markdown supports unordered, ordered, and task lists:

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

## Extended Syntax

_Standard_ Markdown covers the basics, but many parsers support **extended syntax**[^2] — including tables, footnotes, task lists, and the HTML-based formatting like <mark>highlighting</mark>, superscripts like E=mc<sup>2</sup>, and subscripts like H<sub>2</sub>O.

Support varies by parser, so always check what your platform supports before relying on extended features.

## Closing Thoughts

Markdown strikes a rare balance: it's **_simple enough for anyone to learn in an afternoon_**, yet powerful enough to write entire books with[^3]. Whether you're a developer documenting an API or a blogger drafting a post, Markdown is one of the most valuable plain-text tools in your kit.

So open up a `.md` file and start writing — your future self will thank you.
